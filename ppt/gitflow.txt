-> The easiest way to get started is to create an account on GitHub.com (it's free).
->username , enter your email address and a password, and click Sign up for GitHub.
 Once you are in, and in right of the above screen

Step 2: Create a new repository

->A repository is like a place or a container where something is stored; 
->In this case we're creating a Git repository to store code. 
->To create a new repository, 
                select New Repository  
   1)Enter a name for your repository (e.g, "mylearningnodejs").
   2)And u select private (it can see everyone)
   3)and click Create Repository.

 "THIS IS THE PROCESS TO CREATE REPO."
"After created on repo one url it is show "eg https://github.com/jaswanth-jash/mylearningnodejs"

Step 3: Create a file

->firstly it is show branch and some 5 command.
  1)Branch - Master
  2)Commands;
    ->git init
    ->git status
    ->git add (or) git add .
    ->git commit -m ""
    ->git push

->Open the command prompt program on your computer.
1) Type install Git and enter
2)mkdir nodejs(created one folder)
3)cd nodejs(we can go to that folder)
4)we create 2 files in that Readme.md and .gitignore
->readme.md means what concept we write in that folder that we write
->gitignore means which file doesnt exits

And we add all these then after -----

Step 4: Make a commit

->y we this comment means to write a which program u write in that file.
Are else this is my first program can we write that y we use this comment.
->


Step 5: Connect your GitHub repo with your computer

  "git remote add origin https://github.com/jaswanth-jash/mylearningnodejs"
->We are telling Git to add a remote called origin with the address
 https://github.com/jaswanth-jash/mylearningnodejs(i.e., the URL of your Git repo on GitHub.com).
-> we have added the remote, we can push our code (i.e., upload our README.md file) to GitHub.com.

finally it is show in repo file.
